# Assignment07:  A "pickled" Latin dictionary with error handling
**Dev:** *T. Ward*   
**Date:** *12.1.2020*

## Introduction 
For assignment #7, we are to create a demo that demonstrates how pickling and structured error handling work.  To accomplish this, I have created a “pickled” Latin dictionary demo that also includes exception handling code.  This website will describe the steps taken to create the demo and ensure it works as expected.  As with past assignments PyCharm is used here for script development.

## Resources
Before script development commenced, internet research was performed on pickling and exception handling resources.   I found that the same sources had very helpful instructional material on both topics.  These sources are listed below along with reasoning for their recommendation: 

### Helpful Pickling Resources
•	https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pickle-python-tutorial
  o	In addition to containing well-written instructional material, Datacamp provides an opportunity for additional practice.  This site was the most helpful to the pickling portion of demo development.
•	https://realpython.com/python-pickle-module/
  o	This external resource puts pickling in a larger context and introduces concepts that were not introduced thus far in the course (e.g., serialization and deserialization)
•	https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html
  o	This website succinctly covers important concepts on pickling.

### Helpful Exception Handling Resources
•	https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/exception-handling-python 
  o	This well-written site introduces basic concepts and additional opportunities for practice.
•	https://realpython.com/lessons/introduction-exceptions/
  o	This site has a 101 class on exceptions that was very well done and easy to understand.
•	https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html
  o	This site was the most helpful to the exception handling portion of demo development.
